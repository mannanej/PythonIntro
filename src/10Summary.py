# TODO: 1.
#   Write code that accomplishes the following (and ONLY the following),
#   in the order listed:
#
#    - Constructs a Turtle with a  'blue'  Pen.
#
#    - Makes the Turtle go straight UP 200 pixels.
#
#    - Makes the Turtle lift its pen UP
#         (so that the next movements do NOT leave a "trail")
#
#    - Makes the Turtle go to the Point at (100, -40).
#
#    - Makes the Turtle put its pen DOWN
#         (so that the next movements will return to leaving a "trail").
#
#    - Makes the Turtle's pen have color 'green' and thickness 10.
#
#    - Makes the Turtle go 150 pixels straight DOWN.
#
#   Don't forget to:
#     - import turtle and construct a window
#          at the BEGINNING of your code, and to
#     - ask your window to wait
#          as the LAST line of your code.
#
#   As always, test by running the module.
